## Business Problem

Companies often face losses due to poor inventory practices, inefficient pricing strategies, and vendor over-dependence. This analysis aims to:

- Identify underperforming brands needing promotional or pricing adjustments.
- Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit.
- Analyze the effect of bulk purchasing on unit cost.
- Assess inventory turnover to improve efficiency and reduce holding costs.
- Investigate profitability variance between high- and low-performing vendors

## Data Aggregation using SQL (Final Query)
The query below creates the final `vendor_sales_summary` by joining purchase, sales, and freight data using Common Table Expressions (CTEs):

```python
vendor_sales_summary = pd.read_sql_query("""
WITH FreightSummary AS (
    SELECT
        VendorNumber, 
        SUM(Freight) AS FreightCost 
    FROM vendor_invoice
    GROUP BY VendorNumber
), 
PurchaseSummary AS (
    SELECT
        p.VendorNumber,
        p.VendorName,
        p.Brand, 
        p.Description, 
        p.PurchasePrice, 
        pp.Volume, 
        pp.Price AS ActualPrice,
        SUM(p.Quantity) AS TotalPurchaseQuantity,
        SUM(p.Dollars) AS TotalPurchaseDollars
    FROM purchases p
    JOIN purchase_prices pp
        ON p.Brand = pp.Brand
    WHERE p.PurchasePrice > 0
    GROUP BY 
        p.VendorNumber, p.VendorName, p.Brand, p.Description, p.PurchasePrice, pp.Price, pp.Volume
),
SalesSummary AS (
    SELECT 
        VendorNo, 
        Brand, 
        SUM(SalesDollars) AS TotalSalesDollars,
        SUM(SalesPrice) AS TotalSalesPrice,
        SUM(SalesQuantity) AS TotalSalesQuantity,
        SUM(ExciseTax) AS TotalExciseTax
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY VendorNo, Brand
)
SELECT 
    ps.VendorNumber,
    ps.VendorName, 
    ps.Brand,
    ps.Description, 
    ps.PurchasePrice, 
    ps.ActualPrice,
    ps.Volume, 
    ps.TotalPurchaseQuantity, 
    ps.TotalPurchaseDollars,
    ss.TotalSalesQuantity,
    ss.TotalSalesDollars,
    ss.TotalSalesPrice,
    ss.TotalExciseTax,
    fs.FreightCost
FROM PurchaseSummary ps 
LEFT JOIN SalesSummary ss
    ON ps.VendorNumber = ss.VendorNo
    AND ps.Brand = ss.Brand
LEFT JOIN FreightSummary fs
    ON ps.VendorNumber = fs.VendorNumber
ORDER BY ps.TotalPurchaseDollars DESC
